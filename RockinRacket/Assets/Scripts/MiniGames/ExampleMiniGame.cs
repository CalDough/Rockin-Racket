    This script is a example for a connecting GameEvent class. There are so many events so we might have to cut it down for simplicity.
    It would also make sense to use inheritence from the GameEvent class, but I haven't gotten time to work that out with this.
    GameEvent prefabs will have a script like this to handle connecting to UI, and mini-game logic like button presses etc. 
    See GameEvent script and the prefab for this an event for more info.
